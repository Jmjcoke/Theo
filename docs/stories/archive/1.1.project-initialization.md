## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Current Project State Analysis
Based on existing project structure, most foundational work is already complete:
- ✅ Git repository exists and is connected to GitHub
- ✅ Monorepo structure established with proper npm workspaces configuration
- ✅ `apps/` directory contains: web (React), api (FastAPI), workers (Celery)
- ✅ `packages/` directory exists (ready for shared code)
- ✅ Root `package.json` includes TypeScript and workspace configuration
- ✅ README.md exists with project title
- ❌ **Missing**: Root-level ESLint configuration
- ❌ **Missing**: Root-level TypeScript configuration
- ❌ **Missing**: Prettier configuration

### Technology Stack Requirements  
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]
- Frontend: React/Vite with TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI/Python  
- Monorepo management: npm workspaces

### Coding Standards to Follow
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#file-and-directory-naming]
- Use kebab-case for directories: `user-management`, `document-processing`
- Use PascalCase for React components: `UserDashboard.tsx`, `DocumentTable.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility files: `apiClient.ts`, `dateUtils.ts`

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#variable-and-function-naming]
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `userId`, `processingStatus`, `handleSubmit`
- Use PascalCase for types and interfaces: `User`, `DocumentMetadata`, `ProcessingResult`
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `API_BASE_URL`

### Root Configuration Requirements
**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Root `tsconfig.json` should provide base configuration for monorepo
- Enable path mapping for packages/* imports
- Configure for modern TypeScript features

**ESLint Configuration:**
- Use modern flat config format (`eslint.config.js`)
- Support TypeScript and React
- Integrate with existing app-level configurations
- Include workspace-aware rules

**Prettier Configuration:**
- Consistent formatting across entire monorepo
- Integration with ESLint to avoid conflicts

### Testing
[Source: No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs]
Testing requirements for this foundational story:
- Verify TypeScript compilation works at root level
- Confirm ESLint runs without errors on existing code
- Ensure Prettier formatting works across monorepo
- Validate all package.json scripts execute properly

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
No debug log entries required - implementation proceeded without blocking issues.

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully created root-level TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) with monorepo-appropriate settings
- Added comprehensive ESLint configuration (`eslint.config.js`) using modern flat config format
- Configured ESLint to work with TypeScript, React, and monorepo structure

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-22
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation with comprehensive configuration setup.** The developer successfully created a solid foundation for the monorepo with modern tooling configurations. All acceptance criteria met with high technical standards. The TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configurations are well-structured and follow current best practices.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `package.json`
  - **Change**: Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
  - **Why**: Eliminates ES module warning from Node.js when running ESLint config
  - **How**: Improves performance and removes console warnings during linting operations

- **File**: `tsconfig.json`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive path mappings for all apps (`@api/*`, `@workers/*`)
  - **Why**: Provides consistent import patterns across all monorepo applications
  - **How**: Enables clean imports and better IDE support for cross-app references

- **File**: `eslint.config.js`
  - **Change**: Enhanced ESLint rules with additional TypeScript and code quality checks
  - **Why**: Improves code quality enforcement and catches more potential issues
  - **How**: Added consistent-type-imports, no-duplicate-enum-values, no-console warnings, and React-specific fixes for common UI library patterns

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All configurations follow established naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed at correct root level as specified
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Configurations validated and tested successfully
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Enhanced package.json with ES module support to eliminate warnings
- [x] Expanded TypeScript path mappings for comprehensive monorepo support
- [x] Improved ESLint configuration with additional quality rules
- [x] Added React-specific rule configurations for UI library compatibility
- [x] Validated all tooling configurations work correctly

### Security Review
**No security concerns identified.** All configuration files properly exclude sensitive directories (node_modules, dist, build) and include appropriate ignore patterns. No hardcoded secrets or security vulnerabilities introduced.

### Performance Considerations
**Configuration optimized for performance:**
- ES module configuration reduces Node.js parsing overhead
- TypeScript noEmit mode optimizes compilation for type checking only
- ESLint flat config provides better performance than legacy configurations
- Proper ignore patterns prevent unnecessary file processing

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary:** Outstanding foundational work with modern, well-configured tooling. The refactoring improvements enhance the original implementation without changing core functionality. All configurations are production-ready and follow current best practices. Story can be marked as complete.
