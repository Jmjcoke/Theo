# Archived Stories - Pre-PocketFlow Implementation

## Purpose
This archive contains stories that were implemented before the comprehensive PocketFlow integration was completed. These stories were developed using traditional Python patterns rather than PocketFlow Node/Flow architecture.

## Archived Stories
- `1.1.project-initialization.md` - Initial project setup
- `1.2.backend-app-setup.md` - FastAPI backend setup  
- `1.3.frontend-app-setup.md` - React frontend setup
- `1.4.database-schema-initialization.md` - Database schema design

## Why Archived
These stories were implemented without:
- ✅ 150-line Node limits
- ✅ PocketFlow cookbook pattern compliance  
- ✅ AsyncNode usage for I/O operations
- ✅ Proper shared store communication
- ✅ Supabase integration with PocketFlow patterns

## Current Status
Development has been reset to implement all functionality using proper PocketFlow patterns from the beginning. The new stories will be created by the enhanced SM agent with full PocketFlow requirements enforcement.

## BMAD Integration Status
- ✅ All 8 phases of BMAD + PocketFlow integration completed
- ✅ Agent configurations enforce PocketFlow patterns
- ✅ Story templates require cookbook compliance
- ✅ Validation system includes PocketFlow checks
- ✅ Development tools support automatic enforcement

## Date Archived
July 22, 2025 - Strategic reset for PocketFlow-first development approach.
