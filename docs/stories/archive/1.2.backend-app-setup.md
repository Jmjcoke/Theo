# Story 1.2: Backend App Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a basic FastAPI backend application with a single health-check endpoint,  
**so that** I can verify the server is running correctly on my local machine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new FastAPI application named `api` is created within the `apps/` directory.
2. All necessary Python dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn) are defined and installable.
3. A `/health` endpoint is created that returns a `{"status": "ok"}` JSON response.
4. The backend server can be started with a single command.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create FastAPI application structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `apps/api/` directory structure
  - [x] Create `apps/api/src/` directory for source code
  - [x] Create `apps/api/main.py` as the FastAPI application entry point
  - [x] Create `apps/api/requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
- [x] Task 2: Define Python dependencies (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add FastAPI to requirements.txt
  - [x] Add Uvicorn as ASGI server to requirements.txt
  - [x] Add any additional Python project setup dependencies
  - [x] Ensure dependencies are installable and compatible
- [x] Task 3: Implement health check endpoint (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `/health` GET endpoint in FastAPI application
  - [x] Return JSON response `{"status": "ok"}`
  - [x] Ensure proper HTTP status code (200)
- [x] Task 4: Add startup scripts and documentation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create simple startup script or document command to run the server
  - [x] Test that server starts correctly on localhost
  - [x] Verify health endpoint is accessible at server URL

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Monorepo structure is established with `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- Root-level TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configurations are working
- `npm workspaces` is configured and functional
- Development environment foundation is solid

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- **Backend Stack:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Supabase (Postgres w/ pgvector), JWT, bcrypt, SSE, OpenAI API, Celery/Redis
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo using `npm workspaces`

[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Technical Summary:** FastAPI/Python backend deployed on DigitalOcean
- **Platform Choice:** DigitalOcean (Droplets, Managed Redis, Spaces)

### Coding Standards to Follow
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#file-and-directory-naming]
- Use kebab-case for directories: `user-management`, `document-processing`
- Use camelCase for utility files: `apiClient.ts`, `dateUtils.ts`

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#variable-and-function-naming]
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `userId`, `processingStatus`, `handleSubmit`
- Use snake_case for database table/column names: `users`, `user_id`, `created_at`

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#api-naming]
- Use kebab-case for endpoints: `/api/user-management`, `/api/document-upload`
- Use camelCase for JSON keys: `userId`, `createdAt`, `processingStatus`

### File Locations
Based on existing monorepo structure and architectural patterns:
- **Main application:** `apps/api/main.py`
- **Source code:** `apps/api/src/` (for modular structure as project grows)
- **Dependencies:** `apps/api/requirements.txt`
- **Configuration:** Environment variables and settings as needed

### API Architecture Notes
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- Backend will use modular PocketFlow pattern for AI workflows
- Will connect to Supabase for vector database and Celery/Redis for background jobs
- RESTful API endpoints serving React frontend

### Testing
[Source: No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs]
Testing requirements for this foundational story:
- Verify FastAPI application starts without errors
- Confirm `/health` endpoint returns correct JSON response
- Test basic HTTP connectivity and response format
- Validate Python dependencies install correctly
