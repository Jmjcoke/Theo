# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Done

## PocketFlow Requirements

**Required PocketFlow Pattern Type**: None for this foundational story - establishes structure for future pattern implementations

**Cookbook Example Reference**: N/A - Infrastructure setup story

**Node Breakdown**: 
- This story creates the foundation for future PocketFlow Node implementations
- All future Nodes will be created in the established structure:
  - Backend Nodes: `apps/api/src/nodes/{category}/{purpose}_node.py` (≤150 lines)
  - Worker AsyncNodes: `apps/workers/src/nodes/{category}/{purpose}_node.py` (≤150 lines)

**AsyncNode Requirements**: N/A - No I/O operations in this infrastructure story

**Shared Store Communication**: N/A - Sets up structure for future shared store patterns

**Flow Orchestration**: 
- Establishes directory structure for future Flows:
  - Application Flows: `apps/api/src/flows/{workflow}_flow.py`
  - Background Flows: `apps/workers/src/flows/{workflow}_flow.py`

## Dev Notes

**Source Tree Information** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Root Level Organization**: Project follows PocketFlow-First Architecture with BMAD Workflow Integration
- **Directory Structure**: Monorepo with `apps/`, `packages/`, `docs/`, `.bmad-core/`, `PocketFlow-main/`
- **Application Structure**: Each app follows PocketFlow Node/Flow organization patterns
- **Backend Structure**: `apps/api/src/nodes/`, `apps/api/src/flows/`, `apps/api/src/utils/`
- **Frontend Structure**: `apps/web/src/components/`, `apps/web/src/services/`, `apps/web/src/stores/`
- **Worker Structure**: `apps/workers/src/nodes/`, `apps/workers/src/flows/`, `apps/workers/src/tasks/`

**PocketFlow Framework Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Framework Version**: PocketFlow v0.0.2
- **Installation**: `pip install -e ./PocketFlow-main`
- **Core Patterns**: Agent, Workflow, RAG, Map-Reduce, Supervisor patterns available
- **Node Limit**: All future Nodes must not exceed 150 lines of code
- **Pattern Location**: Cookbook examples in `/PocketFlow-main/cookbook/`

**Coding Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **File Naming**: 
  - Node files: `{purpose}_node.py` 
  - Flow files: `{workflow}_flow.py`
  - React components: `{ComponentName}.tsx` (PascalCase)
- **Directory Naming**: Use kebab-case for directories
- **150-Line Node Limit**: Mandatory for all PocketFlow Nodes (validated by `wc -l`)
- **Cookbook Compliance**: All implementations must reference cookbook examples

**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Backend**: FastAPI 0.115.0 with PocketFlow integration
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm for frontend, pip for backend
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier with PocketFlow patterns
- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend

**Project Structure Validation** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Structure aligns with defined PocketFlow-first organization
- All paths match unified project structure specifications
- BMAD workflow integration points correctly established
- Directory structure supports cookbook pattern implementations

### Testing
**PocketFlow Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Node Unit Tests**: Future Nodes will require prep/exec/post phase testing independently
- **Flow Integration Tests**: Future Flows will require end-to-end execution testing  
- **Test Locations**: `apps/api/tests/nodes/`, `apps/api/tests/flows/`, `apps/web/tests/`
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with PocketFlow async testing extensions for backend
- **Node Size Validation**: All Nodes must be validated ≤150 lines via `wc -l` command
- **Cookbook Compliance Tests**: Future implementations must validate against cookbook patterns
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Line count validation for Node size limits
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated Node size and PocketFlow compliance checking

**Infrastructure Testing Requirements**:
- Validate directory structure matches unified project structure
- Verify linting configuration works with PocketFlow coding standards
- Test that pre-commit hooks properly validate Node size limits
- Ensure TypeScript configuration supports PocketFlow development patterns

### Debug Log References
No debug logs required for infrastructure setup tasks.

### Completion Notes List
- **Task 1**: GitHub repository already existed and was properly configured with origin remote
- **Task 2**: All monorepo directories were already present; created missing PocketFlow-compliant source structure (`apps/api/src/nodes`, `apps/api/src/flows`, etc.)
- **Task 3**: All configuration files were present; updated ESLint and TypeScript configs to exclude archive directories; created pre-commit hook for Node size validation
- **Task 4**: Enhanced existing README.md with comprehensive PocketFlow integration documentation and monorepo navigation guide

### File List
**Modified Files:**
- `README.md` - Enhanced with comprehensive project documentation and PocketFlow integration
- `eslint.config.js` - Updated ignores to exclude archive directories and build artifacts  
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated excludes to prevent TypeScript errors from archived files
- `package.json` - Updated lint commands to target specific source directories
- `docs/stories/1.1.project-initialization.md` - Updated Dev Agent Record sections

**Created Files:**
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook for PocketFlow Node size validation (150-line limit)

**Created Directories:**
- `apps/api/src/nodes/{auth,chat,documents,workflows}` - PocketFlow Node organization
- `apps/api/src/{flows,utils,api,core,admin}` - Backend source structure
- `apps/api/tests/{nodes,flows,api,integration}` - Backend testing structure
