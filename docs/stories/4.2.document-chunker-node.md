# Story 4.2: The 'Document Chunker' Node

## Status
✅ **QA APPROVED** - Exceptional Implementation Quality

## Story
**As a** developer, **I want** a PocketFlow `Node` that chunks document content according to its type, **so that** the text is properly prepared for the embedding model.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `DocumentChunkerNode` is created that accepts document content and type from the shared store.
2. For `biblical` documents, it chunks the text into groups of 5 verses with a 1-verse overlap, preserving citation metadata.
3. For `theological` documents, it chunks the text into 1000-character segments with a 200-character overlap.
4. The node outputs a list of all text chunks into the `Shared Store`.
5. The node updates the processing status and includes chunk count metadata.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
From Story 4.1 (File Loader Node) completion:
- Document content is available in shared store with key `document_content`
- Document metadata is available with key `document_metadata`
- Document type (`biblical` or `theological`) is available in metadata
- Document ID and processing status are tracked in SQLite database
- File content has been extracted and preprocessed by FileLoaderNode

### PocketFlow Pipeline Context
**Pipeline Position** [Source: prd/epic-and-story-details.md#epic-4-pocketflow-processing-pipeline]:
- **Second Node**: DocumentChunkerNode follows FileLoaderNode in the processing pipeline
- **Input**: Raw document content and metadata from shared store
- **Output**: List of structured text chunks with metadata in shared store
- **Next Nodes**: EmbeddingGeneratorNode (Story 4.3) will generate embeddings for each chunk
- **Pipeline Flow**: File Loader → **Document Chunker** → Embedding Generator → Supabase Storage

### Document Type Processing Requirements

#### Biblical Document Chunking [Source: prd/epic-and-story-details.md#story-4-2]:
- **Chunk Size**: Groups of 5 verses
- **Overlap**: 1-verse overlap between consecutive chunks
- **Metadata Preservation**: Book, chapter, verse ranges must be maintained
- **Citation Format**: Standard biblical citation format (e.g., "John 3:16-20")
- **Edge Cases**: Handle chapters with fewer than 5 verses, incomplete verse structures

#### Theological Document Chunking [Source: prd/epic-and-story-details.md#story-4-2]:
- **Chunk Size**: 1000-character segments
- **Overlap**: 200-character overlap between consecutive chunks
- **Boundary Detection**: Avoid breaking mid-word or mid-sentence where possible
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintain paragraph boundaries when feasible
- **Text Cleanup**: Handle formatting artifacts from document conversion

### Shared Store Data Structure

**Input Keys from FileLoaderNode**:
- `document_id`: Document identifier
- `document_content`: Raw extracted text content
- `document_metadata`: File metadata including document type
- `processing_started_at`: Processing start timestamp
- `file_info`: File-specific information

**Output Keys for EmbeddingGeneratorNode**:
- `document_chunks`: List of structured chunks with metadata
- `chunk_count`: Total number of chunks created
- `chunking_completed_at`: Timestamp when chunking completed
- `chunk_metadata`: Chunking method and parameters used

### Chunk Data Structure
```python
{
    "chunk_id": str,           # Unique identifier for the chunk
    "chunk_index": int,        # Sequential index in document
    "content": str,            # The actual text content
    "chunk_type": str,         # "biblical_verse_group" | "theological_segment"
    "document_id": str,        # Source document identifier
    "metadata": {
        # For biblical chunks:
        "book": str,           # Bible book name
        "chapter": int,        # Chapter number
        "verse_start": int,    # Starting verse number
        "verse_end": int,      # Ending verse number
        "citation": str,       # Full citation string
        
        # For theological chunks:
        "char_start": int,     # Starting character position
        "char_end": int,       # Ending character position
        "paragraph_index": int, # Paragraph number if applicable
        
        # Common fields:
        "overlap_with_previous": bool,
        "overlap_with_next": bool
    }
}
```

### Technology Stack Integration
**Backend Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-stack]:
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.115.0 with PocketFlow Node/Flow patterns
- **Text Processing**: Python string manipulation and regex for text parsing
- **Database**: SQLite for development, AsyncNode patterns for database I/O
- **Dependencies**: Regular expressions for biblical text parsing, text processing utilities

**PocketFlow Architecture Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#pocketflow-pattern-implementation]:
- **150-Line Node Limit**: DocumentChunkerNode MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code
- **Node Pattern**: Single responsibility, stateless, communicates via shared store
- **AsyncNode Pattern**: Required for processing operations and shared store access
- **Cookbook Compliance**: Follow proven patterns from PocketFlow cookbook examples

### AsyncNode Implementation Standards
**AsyncNode Pattern for Text Processing** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#pocketflow-development-standards]:
```python
class DocumentChunkerNode(AsyncNode):
    """Chunks document content based on document type"""
    
    async def prep(self, shared_store):
        """Validate document content and metadata availability"""
        
    async def exec(self, data):
        """Chunk document content according to type-specific rules"""
        
    async def post(self, result, shared_store):
        """Update shared store with chunks and update processing status"""
```

### Biblical Text Processing Considerations
**Verse Detection Patterns**:
- Handle various biblical text formats (verse numbers, chapter headings)
- Account for different translation styles and formatting
- Preserve original verse numbering and citation accuracy
- Handle special cases (psalm titles, cross-references, footnotes)

**Citation Standards**:
- Use standard biblical citation format (Book Chapter:Verse-Verse)
- Handle book name abbreviations and full names
- Ensure citation accuracy for verse ranges and overlaps

### Theological Document Processing Considerations
**Smart Boundary Detection**:
- Prefer sentence boundaries over mid-sentence breaks
- Maintain paragraph integrity when possible within character limits
- Handle various document structures (headers, bullet points, quotes)
- Preserve important formatting markers (emphasis, citations)

**Character Counting**:
- Use UTF-8 character counting for consistency
- Handle special characters and Unicode properly
- Account for whitespace normalization in chunk boundaries

### Error Handling Requirements
**Node Error Handling** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#error-handling-architecture]:
- Handle malformed document content gracefully
- Manage insufficient content for chunking requirements
- Deal with invalid document type specifications
- Implement retry logic for transient processing errors
- Log chunking metrics and performance statistics

**Chunking Error Recovery**:
- Fallback to simpler chunking strategies for problematic text
- Handle edge cases (very short documents, unusual formatting)
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Update document status to 'failed' on unrecoverable errors

### Performance Considerations
**Text Processing Optimization**:
- Efficient string operations for large documents
- Memory-conscious chunking for large theological works
- Batch processing strategies for multiple chunks
- Async processing patterns to avoid blocking event loop

**Scalability Requirements**:
- Design compatible with BatchNode for parallel document processing
- Support for MapReduce pattern in future pipeline scaling
- Efficient memory usage for large document processing
- Performance metrics tracking for optimization
