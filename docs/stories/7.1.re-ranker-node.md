# Story 7.1: The 'Re-ranker' Node

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer, **I want** to add a PocketFlow `Node` that re-ranks the initial search results for improved contextual relevance, **so that** the generator receives the best possible information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new `ReRankerNode` is created in the backend.
2. The node takes the user's query and the initial list of document chunks.
3. It uses a secondary, more focused LLM call to re-score and re-order the chunks.
4. The node places the newly ordered, top-k chunks back into the `Shared Store`.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
From Story 6.1 (Basic RAG Pipeline Backend):
- **PocketFlow Node Patterns**: AsyncNode implementation with prep/exec/post phases established
- **Shared Store Communication**: Data passing patterns between Nodes in RAG pipeline
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Error handling, rate limiting, and response parsing patterns
- **SupabaseSearchNode Output**: Document chunk format and metadata structure
- **BasicRAGFlow Orchestration**: Sequential Node execution and data flow patterns

From Story 6.3 (Source Citation Display):
- **DocumentSource Interface**: Standard format for document chunks with relevance scoring
- **Metadata Preservation**: Requirements for maintaining source citation information

### PocketFlow Architecture Context [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#pocketflow-pattern-implementation]

**Re-ranker Node Implementation Pattern**:
- **File Location**: `apps/api/src/nodes/chat/re_ranker_node.py`
- **Class Pattern**: `class ReRankerNode(AsyncNode)`
- **Size Constraint**: Maximum 150 lines including imports and docstrings
- **Pattern Source**: Adapt from `PocketFlow-main/cookbook/pocketflow-rag/` re-ranking examples

**Shared Store Communication Pattern**:
```python
# Input from shared store (from SupabaseSearchNode)
search_results = shared_store.get("search_results")
query = shared_store.get("user_query")

# Output to shared store (for SimpleGeneratorNode)
shared_store.set("re_ranked_results", reranked_chunks)
shared_store.set("re_ranking_metadata", metrics)
```

### Re-ranking Algorithm Specifications

**LLM Re-ranking Approach**:
- **Model Selection**: GPT-4 for high-quality relevance assessment
- **Prompt Strategy**: Focused theological relevance scoring prompt
- **Input Format**: Query + chunk pairs for relevance evaluation
- **Output Format**: Numerical relevance scores (0.0-1.0) for re-ordering

**Re-ranking Prompt Template**:
```
You are a theological AI assistant specializing in biblical and doctrinal analysis.

Query: "{user_query}"

Evaluate the relevance of this document chunk to the query for theological research:
Chunk: "{document_chunk}"

Consider:
- Direct scriptural relevance
- Theological doctrinal connection
- Historical/contextual importance
- Hermeneutical significance

Provide a relevance score from 0.0 to 1.0 where:
- 1.0 = Directly answers the query with high theological precision
- 0.7-0.9 = Strong theological relevance with good supporting context
- 0.4-0.6 = Moderate relevance with useful background information
- 0.1-0.3 = Tangentially related theological content
- 0.0 = No meaningful theological relevance

Score: [0.0-1.0]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation of relevance assessment]
```

### API Integration Patterns [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#openai-integration]

**OpenAI API Configuration**:
- **Model**: `gpt-4` for re-ranking accuracy
- **Temperature**: `0.1` for consistent scoring
- **Max Tokens**: `150` for score + reasoning
- **Timeout**: `30 seconds` with retry logic
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect OpenAI API limits with exponential backoff

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- **API Failures**: Return original search order with warning log
- **Malformed Responses**: Fallback to heuristic scoring based on keyword matching
- **Timeout Issues**: Cache partial results and complete re-ranking in background
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement queue system for batch re-ranking requests

### Performance Optimization Strategies

**Caching Strategy**:
- **Query Similarity**: Cache re-ranking results for semantically similar queries
- **Chunk Fingerprinting**: Avoid re-ranking identical document chunks
- **TTL Policy**: 24-hour cache expiration for dynamic content updates
- **Storage**: Redis or in-memory cache for fast retrieval

**Batch Processing**:
- **Optimal Batch Size**: 5-10 chunks per re-ranking API call
- **Parallel Processing**: Async processing for multiple batch requests
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute re-ranking load across multiple API keys if available
- **Monitoring**: Track re-ranking latency and adjust batch sizes dynamically

### Integration Points [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#backend-application-structure]

**RAG Pipeline Integration**:
- **Current Flow**: QueryEmbedder → SupabaseSearch → SimpleGenerator
- **Enhanced Flow**: QueryEmbedder → SupabaseSearch → **ReRanker** → SimpleGenerator
- **Data Compatibility**: Maintain DocumentSource interface for seamless integration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Make re-ranking optional via configuration flag

**Configuration Management**:
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `RERANKING_ENABLED=true` - Enable/disable re-ranking feature
  - `RERANKING_MODEL=gpt-4` - Specify re-ranking model
  - `RERANKING_TOP_K=5` - Number of top chunks to return
  - `RERANKING_CACHE_TTL=86400` - Cache time-to-live in seconds

### Testing Strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-testing-stack]

**Unit Testing Requirements**:
- **Node Isolation**: Test ReRankerNode prep/exec/post phases independently
- **Mock OpenAI API**: Use comprehensive mocking for predictable test results
- **Edge Cases**: Test empty results, malformed input, API failures
- **Performance**: Validate re-ranking latency within acceptable thresholds

**Integration Testing Focus**:
- **Pipeline Flow**: Complete RAG flow with re-ranking enabled
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure chunk metadata preservation through re-ranking
- **Error Recovery**: Test graceful degradation when re-ranking fails
- **Cache Behavior**: Validate caching logic and cache invalidation

**Sample Test Cases**:
```python
def test_reranker_node_theological_query():
    """Test re-ranking with sample theological query"""
    query = "What does Paul teach about justification by faith?"
    chunks = [sample_romans_chunk, sample_galatians_chunk, sample_unrelated_chunk]
    # Expect theological chunks ranked higher than unrelated content

def test_reranker_fallback_on_api_failure():
    """Test graceful degradation when OpenAI API fails"""
    # Mock API failure, verify original order returned with warning
```

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

**Re-ranking Accuracy Validation**:
- **Theological Expert Review**: Sample re-ranking results for doctrinal accuracy
- **A/B Testing**: Compare user satisfaction with/without re-ranking
- **Relevance Metrics**: Track click-through rates on re-ranked sources
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure re-ranking improves response quality

**Production Readiness Criteria**:
- [ ] Re-ranking improves relevance scores by >15% on test dataset
- [ ] Added latency stays under 2 seconds for typical queries
- [ ] Error rate remains under 1% with proper fallback behavior
- [ ] Cache hit rate exceeds 30% for common theological queries
