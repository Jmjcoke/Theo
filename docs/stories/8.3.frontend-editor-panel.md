## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.1: Intent Recognition Node classifies user input as `new_query` vs `format_request`. The intent recognition results are available through the chat API response.

From Story 8.2: FormattingNode processes format_request intents and returns formatted text via the `/api/chat` endpoint. The formatted response includes metadata about formatting operations applied.

### Component Architecture
**React Component Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#frontend-application-structure]
- **Component Location**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/EditorPanel.tsx`
- **Pattern**: PascalCase component naming
- **Integration**: Component fits into existing ChatInterface architecture

**Chat Interface Integration**
```tsx
// Updated ChatInterface component structure
<div className="chat-container">
  <div className="chat-main">
    <MessageList messages={messages} />
    <MessageInput onSend={handleSend} />
  </div>
  <div className="editor-panel">
    <EditorPanel 
      content={editorContent}
      onExport={handleExport}
      onContentChange={handleContentChange}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

### State Management Architecture
**Zustand Store Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#state-management--data-flow]
- **Store Location**: `apps/web/src/stores/chatStore.ts`
- **Pattern**: Zustand for workflow state tracking
- **State Structure**:
```typescript
interface ChatState {
  // Existing chat state
  messages: Message[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  
  // New editor panel state
  editorContent: string;
  isExporting: boolean;
  exportError: string | null;
  
  // Actions
  updateEditorContent: (content: string) => void;
  exportAsMarkdown: () => Promise<void>;
  exportAsPDF: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### UI/UX Framework Implementation
**shadcn/ui Component Usage** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-ux-framework]
- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives) for panel structure
- **Icons**: Lucide React for export button icons
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with CSS variables
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach

**Responsive Panel Design**
```tsx
// Mobile-responsive panel implementation
<div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row h-full">
  <div className="flex-1 min-h-0">
    {/* Chat interface */}
  </div>
  <div className="w-full lg:w-96 border-t lg:border-t-0 lg:border-l">
    {/* Editor panel */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Export Functionality Architecture
**File Export Implementation**
- **Markdown Export**: Direct text file download using Blob API
- **PDF Export**: Client-side PDF generation using pdf-lib library
- **File Naming**: Convention: `theo-export-{timestamp}.{md|pdf}`
- **Download Triggers**: Browser download API with proper MIME types

**Export Service Structure**
```typescript
// apps/web/src/services/exportService.ts
export interface ExportService {
  exportMarkdown(content: string, filename?: string): Promise<void>;
  exportPDF(content: string, filename?: string): Promise<void>;
  generateFilename(extension: string): string;
}
```

### Integration with Backend Services
**API Response Handling** [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#chat-query-system]
- **Chat Response Format**: Editor panel receives content from chat API responses
- **Formatting Integration**: Panel updates when format_request responses are received
- **Real-time Updates**: Panel content updates immediately upon response reception

**Response Processing Flow**
```typescript
// Chat response handling for editor panel
const handleChatResponse = (response: ChatResponse) => {
  // Update messages for chat display
  addMessage(response.message);
  
  // Update editor panel content
  updateEditorContent(response.content);
  
  // Handle formatting metadata if present
  if (response.formattingApplied) {
    showFormattingIndicator(response.formattingApplied);
  }
};
```

}
```

### Integration Points with Stories 8.1 and 8.2
**Intent Recognition Integration** [Source: Story 8.1 context]
- When chat response includes `intent: "format_request"`, editor panel should update with formatted content
- Visual feedback should indicate when formatting operation is in progress
- Panel should highlight changes made by formatting operations

**Formatting Service Integration** [Source: Story 8.2 context]
- Editor panel receives formatted content from FormattingNode responses
- Panel displays both original and formatted versions with change indicators
- Export functionality works with formatted content from FormattingNode

**Shared Store Communication Flow**
1. User sends format_request via chat input
2. Intent Recognition Node classifies as `format_request`
3. FormattingNode processes and returns formatted content
4. Chat API response includes formatted content
5. Frontend updates editor panel with new formatted content
6. User can export the formatted content via export buttons

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths align with the defined frontend project structure in unified-project-structure.md. The editor panel components integrate seamlessly with the existing React application architecture.

**Accessibility Requirements**
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for panel and export functions
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for all panel elements
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus management when panel opens/closes

### Testing
