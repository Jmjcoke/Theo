- [ ] Clear feedback shows supported file types and size limits
- [ ] Upload progress indicator shows individual file progress
- [ ] Failed uploads display specific error messages

### API Integration Points
- `POST /api/documents/upload` - File upload endpoint
- File validation middleware
- Multipart form data handling

### UI/UX Requirements
- DocumentUpload.tsx component with drag-drop zone
- File type validation feedback
- Progress bars for upload status
- File preview/thumbnail display
- Error handling with retry options

### Success Metrics
- All supported file formats upload successfully
- Drag-and-drop interface functions intuitively
- Upload validation prevents invalid file types

## Story 9.2.2: Real-Time Processing Status via SSE
**As a** user who has uploaded documents  
**I want to** see real-time processing status updates  
**So that** I know when my documents are ready for research

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SSE connection establishes immediately after upload
- [ ] Real-time updates show processing stages: "Validating", "Extracting", "Chunking", "Embedding", "Storing"
- [ ] Progress percentage updates in real-time
- [ ] Processing errors are communicated immediately
- [ ] Connection handles network interruptions gracefully
- [ ] Multiple document processing status updates simultaneously
- [ ] SSE connection closes properly when processing completes

### API Integration Points
- `GET /api/documents/status/stream` - SSE endpoint
- Job queue status integration
- Real-time progress tracking

### UI/UX Requirements
- SSE connection management in React
- Live progress indicators
- Status message display
- Error state handling
- Reconnection logic for dropped connections

### Success Metrics
- SSE updates reflect actual processing progress
- Users receive immediate feedback on processing status
- Network interruptions don't break the experience

## Story 9.2.3: Background Job Queue Processing
**As a** system  
**I want to** process uploaded documents in background jobs  
**So that** the user interface remains responsive during heavy processing

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document processing occurs asynchronously after upload
- [ ] Redis/Celery queue manages job scheduling and execution
- [ ] PocketFlow AsyncNodes handle processing workflow
- [ ] Job status updates are published to SSE streams
- [ ] Failed jobs can be retried automatically
- [ ] Processing jobs have configurable timeout limits
- [ ] Queue workers can be scaled based on load

### API Integration Points
- Celery task queuing system
- Redis job status storage
- PocketFlow AsyncFlow orchestration
- Background worker processes

### UI/UX Requirements
- No direct UI requirements (background processing)
- Integration with SSE status updates
- Admin monitoring of queue health

### Success Metrics
- Documents process reliably in background
- Queue handles multiple concurrent uploads
- Processing failures are handled gracefully

## Story 9.2.4: Biblical vs Theological Document Categorization
**As a** user uploading theological content  
**I want** documents to be automatically categorized  
**So that** my research queries can leverage appropriate source types

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System detects biblical content (Genesis.json, Matthew.json, etc.)
- [ ] System identifies theological works (Augustine PDFs, systematic theology)
- [ ] Document metadata includes category classification
- [ ] Categories influence search and retrieval algorithms
- [ ] Manual category override option available
- [ ] Category-specific processing rules applied
- [ ] Search results can be filtered by document category

### API Integration Points
- Document classification service
- Metadata extraction and storage
- Category-aware search algorithms

### UI/UX Requirements
- Category display in document lists
- Category-based filtering options
- Manual categorization interface
- Category indicators in search results

### Success Metrics
- Documents are correctly categorized automatically
- Category-based search provides relevant results
- Manual overrides function properly

## Story 9.2.5: Advanced Text Extraction & Chunking
**As a** system processing documents  
**I want to** extract and chunk text optimally for theological research  
**So that** RAG queries return contextually relevant passages

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDF text extraction preserves formatting and structure
- [ ] JSON biblical content is processed with verse-level granularity
- [ ] Document chunks maintain contextual relationships
- [ ] Chunk size optimization for theological content
- [ ] Metadata preservation during chunking process
- [ ] Special handling for scripture references and citations
- [ ] Chunk overlap prevents context loss at boundaries

### API Integration Points
