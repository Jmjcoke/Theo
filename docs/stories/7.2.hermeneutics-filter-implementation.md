# Story 7.2: The 'Hermeneutics Filter' Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** theological expert, **I want** to implement a master system prompt with the core rules of hermeneutics, **so that** the AI's reasoning is consistently guided by sound biblical interpretation principles.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A configuration file or database entry is created to store the hermeneutics system prompt.
2. The generator `Node` is upgraded to an `AdvancedGeneratorNode`.
3. This new node is required to prepend the hermeneutics system prompt to every call it makes to the OpenAI generation model.
4. The final prompt is structured as: `[Hermeneutics Rules] + [Re-ranked Context] + [User's Question]`.

### Hermeneutics Principles Foundation [Source: theological-research/hermeneutics-framework.md]

**Core Biblical Hermeneutics Rules**:
1. **Scripture Interprets Scripture** (Analogia Scripturae)
2. **Historical-Grammatical Method** - Consider original context, language, audience
3. **Literary Genre Recognition** - Interpret according to text type (narrative, poetry, prophecy, etc.)
4. **Progressive Revelation** - Earlier scriptures inform later ones
5. **Christocentric Interpretation** - All scripture points to Christ
6. **Canonical Consistency** - Interpretations must align with broader biblical teaching
7. **Cultural Context Awareness** - Understand ancient Near Eastern background
8. **Authorial Intent Priority** - Seek what the original author intended to communicate

**Advanced Interpretive Principles**:
- **Sensus Plenior** - Fuller meaning beyond author's immediate awareness
- **Typological Interpretation** - Old Testament types pointing to New Testament fulfillment
- **Covenant Theology Framework** - Understanding redemptive-historical progression
- **Doctrinal Hierarchy** - Clear passages illuminate difficult ones

### Hermeneutics System Prompt Architecture

**Master System Prompt Structure**:
```yaml
hermeneutics_system_prompt:
  version: "1.0"
  sections:
    identity:
      role: "Expert Biblical Scholar and Theologian"
      expertise: "Biblical Hermeneutics, Systematic Theology, Church History"
      approach: "Reformed, Evangelical, Historically Orthodox"
    
    core_principles:
      - "Always interpret Scripture with Scripture (Analogia Scripturae)"
      - "Prioritize historical-grammatical interpretation methods"
      - "Consider original audience, context, and authorial intent"
      - "Recognize literary genres and interpret accordingly"
      - "Maintain Christocentric focus in all interpretations"
      - "Ensure canonical consistency across all biblical teaching"
      - "Apply progressive revelation principles"
      - "Consider cultural and historical background"
    
    methodology:
      - "Examine immediate textual context before broader themes"

      - "Connect individual texts to broader biblical themes"
      - "Offer practical application while maintaining theological precision"
```

### Prompt Composition Implementation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#openai-integration]

**Final Prompt Structure**:
```python
def compose_hermeneutics_prompt(self, hermeneutics_rules: str, context_chunks: List[str], user_query: str) -> str:
    """
    Compose final prompt: [Hermeneutics Rules] + [Re-ranked Context] + [User's Question]
    """
    sections = [
        "=== HERMENEUTICAL FRAMEWORK ===",
        hermeneutics_rules,
        "",
        "=== RELEVANT SOURCE MATERIAL ===",
        self._format_context_chunks(context_chunks),
        "",
        "=== USER QUESTION ===",
        user_query,
        "",
        "=== INSTRUCTIONS ===",
        "Using the hermeneutical framework above and the provided source material, "
        "provide a comprehensive, biblically grounded response to the user's question. "
        "Cite specific biblical references and maintain theological precision."
    ]
    return "\n".join(sections)
```

**Token Management Strategy**:
- **Hermeneutics Section**: ~800 tokens (optimized for clarity + brevity)
- **Context Chunks**: ~2000 tokens (re-ranked top results)
- **User Query**: ~100 tokens (typical question length)
- **Response Budget**: ~1500 tokens (detailed theological answer)
- **Total Budget**: ~4400 tokens (within GPT-4 limits with safety margin)

### AdvancedGeneratorNode Implementation Pattern

**AsyncNode Structure**:
```python
class AdvancedGeneratorNode(AsyncNode):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("AdvancedGenerator")
        self.hermeneutics_config = HermeneuticsConfig()
        self.openai_client = OpenAIClient()
    
    async def prep(self, shared_store: SharedStore) -> bool:
        """Load hermeneutics prompts and validate input data"""
        
    async def exec(self, shared_store: SharedStore) -> bool:
        """Generate theologically guided response using hermeneutics framework"""
        
    async def post(self, shared_store: SharedStore) -> bool:
        """Store response and hermeneutics metadata"""
```

**Configuration Loading Pattern**:
```python
class HermeneuticsConfig:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = "src/config/hermeneutics_prompts.yaml"):
        self.config = self._load_config(config_path)
        self.current_version = self.config.get("version", "1.0")
    
    def get_system_prompt(self, version: str = None) -> str:
        """Retrieve hermeneutics system prompt by version"""
        
    def validate_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> bool:
        """Validate prompt structure and content"""
```
