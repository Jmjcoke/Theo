# Security Considerations
- **Token Storage**: JWT stored in localStorage (consider httpOnly cookies for production)
- **API Integration**: Proper error handling without exposing sensitive data
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side enforcement
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication required for sensitive areas
- **Logout**: Proper token cleanup and redirect
