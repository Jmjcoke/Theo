# Story 1.5: Automated Deployment Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer, **I want** a basic, automated CI/CD pipeline, **so that** any code pushed to the `main` branch is automatically built and deployed to our DigitalOcean server.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A CI/CD pipeline is configured (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
2. The pipeline successfully builds both the `api` and `web` applications.
3. The pipeline includes a step to deploy the built applications to the DigitalOcean Droplet.
4. After a successful deployment, the live backend URL's `/health` endpoint returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
5. After a successful deployment, the live frontend URL correctly displays "Welcome to Theo."

## PocketFlow Requirements

**Required PocketFlow Pattern Type**: Infrastructure deployment - No specific PocketFlow pattern required for CI/CD pipeline setup

**Cookbook Example Reference**: N/A - Infrastructure deployment story, no PocketFlow patterns needed

**Node Breakdown**: 
- No PocketFlow Nodes will be created in this story
- CI/CD pipeline infrastructure supports PocketFlow applications deployment
- Future deployment monitoring Nodes may be created in later stories:
  - `apps/api/src/nodes/monitoring/deployment_health_node.py` (≤150 lines)
  - `apps/api/src/nodes/monitoring/system_status_node.py` (≤150 lines)

**AsyncNode Requirements**: No AsyncNodes required for CI/CD pipeline setup, but infrastructure preparation for future monitoring operations

**Shared Store Communication**: N/A - CI/CD pipeline is infrastructure, not PocketFlow communication patterns

**Flow Orchestration**: 
- No Flows required for this story
- CI/CD pipeline provides deployment foundation for PocketFlow applications
