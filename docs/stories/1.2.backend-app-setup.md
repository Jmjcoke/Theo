## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new FastAPI application named `api` is created within the `apps/` directory.
2. All necessary Python dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn) are defined and installable.

## PocketFlow Requirements

**Required PocketFlow Pattern Type**: Infrastructure setup - No specific pattern required for this foundational story

**Cookbook Example Reference**: No cookbook patterns needed for basic FastAPI setup, but infrastructure preparation for future patterns:
- `pocketflow-fastapi-background/` - Background job processing foundation
- `pocketflow-fastapi-websocket/` - Real-time communication foundation

**Node Breakdown**: 
- This story establishes the FastAPI foundation for future PocketFlow Node implementations
- No Nodes will be created in this story, but directory structure will support:
  - Backend Nodes: `apps/api/src/nodes/{category}/{purpose}_node.py` (≤150 lines each)
  - Future health monitoring Node: `apps/api/src/nodes/system/health_node.py`

**AsyncNode Requirements**: No AsyncNodes required for basic health endpoint, but infrastructure preparation for future async operations

**Shared Store Communication**: No shared store needed for health endpoint, but framework preparation for future Node communication patterns

**Flow Orchestration**: 
- No Flows required for this story
- Foundation prepared for future Flow implementations in `apps/api/src/flows/`

- **Integration Testing**: Basic FastAPI application startup and response validation
- **Future Node Testing**: Infrastructure prepared for Node unit tests (prep/exec/post phases)
- **Future Flow Testing**: Structure ready for Flow integration tests in future stories
- **Performance Testing**: Basic response time validation for health endpoint
- **Test Execution**: Use `pytest apps/api/tests/` command for running test suite

**Health Endpoint Specific Testing**:
- **Response Validation**: Test exact JSON response `{"status": "ok"}`
- **Status Code**: Validate 200 OK response
- **Content Type**: Verify `application/json` content type
- **Performance**: Basic response time under acceptable threshold
- **Application State**: Test that health check indicates server is actually healthy
