# Implementation Archive - Pre-PocketFlow Code

## Purpose
This archive contains implementation code that was developed before comprehensive PocketFlow integration was completed.

## Archived Implementations
- `api/src.archive/` - FastAPI backend implementation using traditional Python patterns
- `web/src.archive/` - React frontend implementation without PocketFlow integration

## Why Archived
The previous implementation was built without:
- ✅ **PocketFlow Node/Flow architecture** - Used traditional Python classes
- ✅ **150-line Node limits** - No size constraints enforced
- ✅ **Cookbook pattern compliance** - No reference to proven patterns
- ✅ **AsyncNode usage** - Synchronous I/O operations
- ✅ **Shared store communication** - Direct function calls instead of shared store
- ✅ **Supabase + PocketFlow integration** - Traditional database access patterns

## Fresh Start Strategy
Development is restarting with:
- ✅ **Enhanced SM Agent** - Creates stories with PocketFlow requirements
- ✅ **Enhanced Dev Agent** - Automatically enforces 150-line Node limits
- ✅ **Enhanced QA Agent** - Validates cookbook compliance
- ✅ **Full BMAD Integration** - Complete PocketFlow development workflow

## Framework Structure Preserved
The following framework elements remain and will be enhanced with PocketFlow patterns:
- **FastAPI** - Will host PocketFlow AsyncNodes and Flows
- **React** - Will integrate with PocketFlow WebSocket/SSE patterns
- **Supabase** - Will be accessed through PocketFlow AsyncNodes
- **TailwindCSS** - UI framework remains unchanged

## Next Steps
1. Create fresh PocketFlow-compliant source directories
2. Use SM agent to create Story 1.1 with full PocketFlow requirements
3. Implement using proper Node/Flow patterns from cookbook examples
4. Ensure all development follows 150-line limits and cookbook compliance
