# Sources and References Panel Fix - Transfer Prompt

## Context Summary
This transfer prompt documents the comprehensive fix for the Sources and References panel in the Theo theological research application. The user reported that the panel showed "Unknown Document" instead of proper document names, displayed 0% relevance scores for all sources, and lacked proper scrolling functionality.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Relevance Scores Showing 0%
**Problem**: All sources displayed 0% relevance instead of actual scores
**Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between search node output and flow expectations
**Solution**: Added relevance field mapping in `supabase_edge_search_node.py:130`
```python
'relevance': rrf_score,  # Add relevance field for compatibility
```
**Result**: 4 out of 5 sources now show 80% relevance (massive improvement)

### 2. ✅ FIXED: "Unknown Document" Display
**Problem**: Sources showed "Unknown Document" instead of actual document names
**Root Cause**: Search results from Supabase only contained basic metadata, missing document titles from SQLite
**Solution**: Enhanced citation_utils.py with metadata enrichment system
- Created `enrich_search_results_with_metadata()` function
- Queries SQLite database to get document titles, types, and metadata
- Updates search nodes to use enrichment pipeline
**Result**: All sources now show proper document titles like "TheForeknowledgeofGod_1"

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Sources Panel Scrolling
**Problem**: Panel content expanded beyond container bounds, no scrolling functionality
**Root Cause**: Complex nested Card structure without proper height constraints
**Solution**: Simplified panel structure in `SourceCitationPanel.tsx`
- Removed complex Card/CardContent wrapper
- Implemented proper flexbox layout with `h-full` and `flex-1`
- Added `flex-shrink-0` for header, `overflow-y-auto` for content area
**Result**: Panel now scrolls properly when content exceeds available space

### 4. ✅ FIXED: Panel Toggle Accessibility
**Problem**: Users could collapse Sources panel but couldn't reopen it
**Root Cause**: Missing toggle mechanism when panel was collapsed
**Solution**: Added floating toggle button in `ChatInterface.tsx`
- Always visible when sources exist
- Shows source count badge
- Positioned as fixed floating element
**Result**: Users can always access Sources panel toggle

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/apps/api/src/nodes/chat/supabase_edge_search_node.py`
   - Line 130: Added `'relevance': rrf_score` field mapping
   - Line 139: Calls `enrich_search_results_with_metadata()`

2. `/apps/api/src/utils/citation_utils.py`
   - Added complete metadata enrichment system
   - `enrich_search_results_with_metadata()` function (lines 44-155)
   - Connects Supabase search results with SQLite document metadata

3. `/apps/api/src/flows/basic_rag_flow.py`
   - Updated source formatting to include enhanced metadata fields
   - Added `document_type`, `approximate_page`, `paragraph_indicator`, `chunk_index`

4. `/apps/web/src/components/chat/SourceCitationPanel.tsx`
   - Complete structural redesign for scrolling (lines 88-170)
   - Simplified flexbox layout replacing Card components
   - Proper height constraints and overflow handling

5. `/apps/web/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`
   - Added floating toggle button (lines 199-214)
   - Enhanced container height constraints (line 188)

6. `/apps/web/src/types/chat.ts`
   - Extended DocumentSource interface with new metadata fields

### Key Technical Patterns:
- **Metadata Enrichment Pipeline**: Search → Enrich → Display
- **Flexbox Scrolling Pattern**: Header (flex-shrink-0) + Content (flex-1 + overflow-y-auto)
- **Field Compatibility Mapping**: Backend field normalization for frontend consumption

## Testing Protocol Used
Following the project's critical testing rule: **ALWAYS USE BROWSER MCP FOR FINAL TESTING**

1. Made code changes
2. Used Browser MCP to navigate to actual interface (http://localhost:8080/chat)
3. Tested exact user workflow (expand sources, check relevance scores, verify scrolling)
4. Verified fixes work in browser before declaring success

## Current Status
- ✅ **Relevance Scores**: 80% of sources show proper relevance (80%) instead of 0%
- ✅ **Document Titles**: All sources display proper names with page/section info
- ✅ **Scrolling**: Panel scrolls correctly with expanded content
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Floating toggle always accessible
- ✅ **Copy Functionality**: Academic citation copying works properly

## Known Remaining Issues
1. **Minor**: One source still shows 0% relevance due to re-ranking JSON parsing errors
2. **Minor**: Some text formatting issues ("a ll" instead of "all") in source content
3. **Backend**: Re-ranking node JSON parsing warnings in logs

## Architecture Notes
This fix maintains strict adherence to PocketFlow patterns:
- AsyncNode methods: `prep_async()`, `exec_async()`, `post_async()`
- Proper return types and signatures
- Shared store communication between nodes

## Validation
- Backend logs show successful metadata enrichment: "Enriched 10 search results with document metadata"
- Frontend displays proper document titles, relevance scores, and scrolling behavior
- User can expand sources, scroll through content, and copy citations for academic use

## Next Developer Actions
If continuing this work:
1. Address remaining JSON parsing errors in re-ranking node
2. Fix text formatting issues in source content chunking
3. Consider adding more metadata fields (author, publication date, etc.)
4. Enhance search and filtering capabilities within Sources panel

This fix transforms the Sources panel from a broken component showing "Unknown Document" and 0% relevance to a fully functional, scrollable academic citation system with proper metadata display.
